    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm I. Sumia â€“ or SumiaDIY, as you may know me online. I'm just a regular girl who loves making beautiful things, whether that's through art, food, family life, or little bits of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in the heart of Chennai, surrounded by the lively sounds and sights of the city. My identity is shaped by the mixed cultures that I come from â€” rooted, real, and quietly resilient.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a mom, a maker, and a lover of quiet creativity. This blog is where I share pieces of my life and what I'm learning along the way. Nothing fancy â€” just homemade joy and honest moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for being here. ðŸ§¡
